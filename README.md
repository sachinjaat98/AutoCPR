## Problem Statement

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a type of death that occurs suddenly and unexpectedly due to a lack of heart function. Approximately 98 percent of the country's population is untrained in CPR, a life-saving practice. In the case of a sudden cardiac arrest, it is the most important and fundamental operation to preserve a life. Mostly, people are unaware about CPR, or they lack the knowledge of administering it correctly. If CPR is given timely and properly, chances of survival may double or even triple.
There are a lot of risks involved with bystander CPR namely: Rib fracture, lung injuries such as pneumothorax and lung contusion, abdominal organ injuries such as hepatic, splenic, and gastric injuries, and chest and/or abdominal discomfort needing analgesics. Hence, there is a need to devise an automated system that can overcome all the drawbacks.

## CONCEPT IDEA OF PROJECT
We are designing a compact, ergonomic, easy to deploy CPR device which is fully automatic and can adjust its functionality according to the need of the user. The device will be compact, portable, flexible, accurate, reliable, cost effective, modular, and integrated with latest technology. We are aiming for achieving the following goals:
• The device would be capable of delivering consistent, continuous compressions throughout the arrest phase.
• Capable of avoiding the serious health complications involved with manual bystander CPR.
• Using IoT enabled microcontrollers to monitor patients' health characteristics such as blood circulation, pulse rate, and pulse oximetry sensors in real time.
• This information will be sent into the CPR mechanism, which will allow our CPR compression system to react to changes.
• Developing a modular product to integrate with existing systems/devices for better results. Reducing the number of rescuers needed to perform CPR at a cardiac arrest.
